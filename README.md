# Projects
These are two projects I have done for my studies. <br>
The first one is an Image Classification Project where 20 items can be classified (tree, pen, shoes, etc.). This was part of a student competition for the best accuracy on a test set by our tutors and I placed 3rd out of 271 students. I couldnt include the model weights since they are too big. <br>
The second one is a group project where we created visualizations from a kaggle dataset.
